# JavaScript code quiz

## Created a timed Javascript coding quiz to work on Fundamentals that stores Highscores

In this quiz I created 8 questions, if I answer incorrectly my timer goes down. The objective is to answer correctly and as fast as possible.

The game ends if all questions are completed or timer hits 0.

Then you would add your Initials then go back to beginning.
